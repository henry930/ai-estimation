1. My Projects page should list by row, like the task list. 
2. In Documents tab, those files should have correct link to that github file 
3. Merge to main branch. Then, setup a S3 hosting for this project. update the database into AWS, as we as build all API under lambda and API gateway. 

** All "to do" should need to update the whole task list, do their estimation, and use seperate branch which aligning with their task. After task completed, create a pull request and let the user review and merge.
